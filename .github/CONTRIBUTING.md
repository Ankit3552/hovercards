## Issues
We encourage you to create issues. We've put an [issue template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) in place to get you started. We use [robinpowered's github labels](https://robinpowered.com/blog/best-practice-system-for-organizing-and-tagging-github-issues/) for our issues, loosely.

## Join us!
We just opened up HoverCards to the world, so we're looking for this to be a community driven project. Our documentation is very spotty and looking for love. Feel free to create issues, chat with us in [our gitter](https://gitter.im/kogg/hovercards), and throw us some pull requests of your own!
